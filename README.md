# 🌟 CreatorStake

**CreatorStake** is a social-investment platform where fans can **invest in creators before they blow up** — and earn rewards as those creators grow.  
It bridges the gap between **creator monetization** and **fan engagement**, powered by AI insights, gamified investment, and real-time analytics.

---

## 🚀 Inspiration
We noticed that talented creators often struggle to get financial support early in their journey, while fans who believed in them from the start get no reward for their early trust.  
CreatorStake solves that by allowing fans to **"stake" on creators**, providing both early funding and a share of the success when those creators rise.
